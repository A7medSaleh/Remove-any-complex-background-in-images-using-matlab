In this code I use many image processing and image segmentation techniques along with active contours to remove any complex background by segmenting the image into foreground and background using Matlab. 

What is nice about this code is that it is fast and it implements multilevel segmentation all together in one code to get most accurate results for images with much variety in zoom, size or resolution.

The code is commented in details at each line to know the idea and algorithm used in it, also with it there is a reference for active contour algorithm used.
